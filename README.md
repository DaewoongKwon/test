# Introduction
Please try to address the following questions as much as possible, different solutions can lead to good results. Feel free to use resources from the internet (stackoverflow etc.) that may help you in answering the questions. 

The following questions assume that you have Python and Git installed on your system.

# Question 1
- Clone the following repo into your local environment: 
- Create a new git branch with a name of your choice

# Question 2 
Consider the following pandas dataframe:

```Python
>>> df = pd.DataFrame([[9, 16]] * 3, columns=['A', 'B'])
>>> df
   A  B
0  9  16
1  9  16
2  9  16
```
Create a new Python file `my_simple_function.py` and write a simple function `transform_df` that takes `df` as an input argument and returns 3 dataframes:

- `df1`: the square root of each element in `df`

```Python
>>> df1
     A    B
0  3.0  4.0
1  3.0  4.0
2  3.0  4.0
```
- `df2`: the column sums of each column in `df`

```Python
>>> df2
A    27
B    48
```

- `df3`: the row sums of each row in `df`

```Python
>>> df3
0    25
1    25
2    25
```

# Question 3

# Question 3
Write a simple class ""

instantiate the class and call the class method

# Question 4
Add docstrings to your class

# Question 5
Write a new class "" that inherets from "" and overrides ""

# Question 6
Consider the following function:

The code in this function violates some of python's coding best practices (for example PEP8). Modify the code to improve on coding best practice   

# Question 7
- Commit your code changes 
- Git push and raise a Pull Request against master branch
